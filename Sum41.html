                <p>
                Tis true without lying, certain and most true.
                That which is below is like that which is above
                and that which is above is like that is below 
                to do the miracles of one only thing
                And as all things have been and arose from one by the mediation of one: 
                so all things have their birth from this one thing by adaptation.
                <br>
                The Sun is its father, 
                the moon its mother, 
                the wind hath carried it in its belly, 
                the earth is its nurse. 
                The father of all perfection in the whole world is here. 
                Its force or power is entire if it be converted into earth.
                <br>
                Separate thou the earth from the fire, 
                the subtle from the gross 
                sweetly with great industry. 
                It ascends from the earth to the heaven
                and again it descends to the earth
                and receives the force of things superior and inferior.
                By this means you shall have the glory of the whole world 
                and thereby all obscurity shall fly from you.
                <br>
                Its force is above all force. 
                For it vanquishes every subtle thing and penetrates every solid thing.
                So was ye world created.
                From this are and do come admirable adaptations 
                where of the means is here in this.
                <br>
                Hence I am called Hermes Trismegist, 
                having the three parts of the philosophy of the whole world
                That which I have said of the operation of the Sun is accomplished and ended.</p>
